My personal journey learning AI, data science, and healthcare machine learning.
# Dharmisha’s AI Learning Journal

Welcome to my AI learning journey!

I’m transitioning from a healthcare background (BDS – Bachelor of Dental Surgery) into the world of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. My goal is to apply AI to solve real-world healthcare problems — from diagnostics to patient insights.

## What I’m Learning
- Python programming
- Data analysis (Pandas, Numpy)
- Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Machine learning (Scikit-learn)
- Healthcare AI and NLP

## Projects Coming Soon
- Dental appointment no-show predictor
- Tooth decay classifier (image-based)
- Patient review sentiment analysis

Stay tuned as I build and share my progress!
